# emg_DL_interhardware

Robotics semester project at the TNE lab (https://www.epfl.ch/labs/tne/)

This project explores deep learning and transfer learning methods for decoding hand poses from EMG signals recorded at the wrist. The goal is to enable inter-hardware compatibility for robotic hand prostheses
